        Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. Launched in 2006, AWS offers over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.
        It is the world's most broadly adopted cloud platform, trusted by millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs.
        AWS services span a wide range of areas including computing power, storage options, and networking. Businesses of all sizes utilize AWS for its scalability, reliability, and security.
        By using AWS, companies can focus more on their core competencies rather than managing and maintaining physical servers, reducing the need for large upfront investments.
        Key services include Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), and Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service).
        AWS continues to innovate with new services and features to help customers stay ahead of their competition.
